# DS3001
Course work for [DS3001: Foundations of Data Science](https://web.wpi.edu/academics/catalogs/ugrad/dscourses.html).

This class involved completing four assignments and one term project. The work for each of those items is listed below:

## Assignment 1
This assignment required exploring an initial dataset and transforming it in order to better understand the data.
The transformation involved handling missing values, converting catagorical data into quantitative data, and utlizing
data science tools found in common Python libraries.

#### Libraries Used
* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
* [scikit-learn](scikit-learn.org/)

## Assignment 2
This assignment required hands on data cleaning and exploratory data analysis.
The data was collected from the web and transformed into a more usable format through a variety of processes.
The objective was to utilize the transformed data in creating and testing prediction accuracy using decision tree classification.
