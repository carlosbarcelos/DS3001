# DS3001
Course work for [DS3001: Foundations of Data Science](https://web.wpi.edu/academics/catalogs/ugrad/dscourses.html).

This class involved completing four assignments and one term project. The work for each of those items is listed below:

## Assignment 1
This assignment required exploring an initial dataset and transforming it in order to better understand the data.
The transformation involved handling missing values, converting catagorical data into quantitative data, and utlizing
data science tools found in common Python libraries.

#### Libraries Used
* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
* [scikit-learn](scikit-learn.org/)

## Assignment 2
This assignment required hands on data cleaning and exploratory data analysis.
The data was collected from the web and transformed into a more usable format through a variety of processes.
The objective was to utilize the transformed data in creating and testing prediction accuracy using decision tree classification.

#### Libraries Used
* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
* [scikit-learn](scikit-learn.org/)

## Assignment 3
This assignment required individual collection, processing, and visualization of a dataset.
For the purposes of this assignment, I selected [Boston Hubway](https://www.thehubway.com/system-data)'s bike share usage data
and manipulated it to create visualizations that would help the bike share administrator make important decisions about their system.
Thinking like a bike share administrator, these are the following questions that I want to answer through
my visualization:
* What is the distribution of the riders?
  * Men v. Women & Customers v. Subscribers
* What bikes are being used the most?
* What is the most popular time that bikes are being used?
  * Day of week & Month of year

#### Libraries Used
* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)

## Assignment 4
This assignment required the use of Hadoop and mapreduce to perform two tasks relating to unique datasets.
Task 1 required converting mapreduce from counting words to counting plaindromes.
Task 2 required manipulating a dataset to find specific information and rank the results. to make decisions.

## Term Project
This project required working in a team of three on a problem of our choosing that is interesting, significant, and relevant to Data Science.
We created an online resource that analyzed a wine review data set in order to answer questions about price v. quality, popularity, and where best to grow the wine among other things.
This project involved the entire data science loop.
