The DS 3001 project for CJ Barcelos, Benjamin Sarkis, and Drew Ciccarelli

Project Overview

For the project, you will work in teams of three or four on a problem of your choosing that is interesting, significant, and relevant to Data Science. You will have great latitude in what you choose to work on, so take advantage of this opportunity to make a big impact!

The primary requirements of the project are:
Your project must use some non-trivial data.
Your project must apply some mining or analytics algorithm.
Your project must use the "data science loop", ultimately leading to a data product or data visualization that can help guide decision making.
